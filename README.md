# COMP 484 – Creating Links Assignment

The main focus of this project is to improve navigation and accessibility. The purpose of the assignment is to practice creating clear, meaningful links that allow the users to jump between pages, access outside resources, and jump to a specific part of a page.

The changes focused on clarity, consistency and ease of use from a visitor's point of view.

## What Was Completed

### Page Navigation (All Pages)

- Updated the navigation list at the top of each page to link the correct pages in the site.
- Used clear, descriptive link text so users understand where each link will take them.
- Ensured navigation works consistently across all pages.

---

### External Links (links.html)

- Turned the first reference to **CSUN** in the footer into a link to the official CSUN website.
- Set the link to open in a new tab or window so users don’t lose their place on the site.
- Added descriptive text to make the purpose of the link clear.
- Added a new footer link labeled **“Follow us on Twitter”** that points to the official CSUN Northridge Twitter profile.

---

### Links to Internal Sections (reference.html & syntax.html)

- Linked text in the first paragraph of `reference.html` to jump directly to the table of named character entities at the bottom of the same page.
- Updated the table so it can be linked to correctly.
- Added a link in `syntax.html` that takes users to the same table on the `reference.html` page, jumping directly to that section.

## Purpose of These Changes

These updates were made to:

- Improve navigation within and between pages
- Make external resources easy to access without disrupting the user experience
- Help users quickly find specific information on longer pages

Overall, the site is now easier to navigate, more intuitive to use, and is more aligned with the basic best practices of web navigation.
